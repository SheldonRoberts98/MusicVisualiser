Features we have implemented so far:
-New Visualisation combining the waveform and the traditional spectrum into one visual
-New Spiral visualisation that moves shapes in a circle based on the song (Work in Progress)
-The addition of the music video for the selected song using p5.dom video library

Features to be implemented:
-Option to change which song and music video play
-A circular beat/bass visual
-A more fleshed out menu system inckuding better visuals
-Better input and controls for the visualiser

How we will deal with problems that may arise:
-When creating visuals, work on parts of them in a blank file to make sure it works before attempting to integrate it with the music visualiser program
-Using the console log to identify errors
-Limited use of global variables to prevent any accidental changes and errors within the program
